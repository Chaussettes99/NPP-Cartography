# NPP-Cartography
A tan/parchment styled Notepad++ theme.
I was unhappy with all available Notepad++ themes and I'm a big fan of gruvbox-y style colors, so I made my own.

# Installation:
Simply drop the cartography.xml file into your Notepad++ themes folder, then select "Cartography" from the theme drop down menu in Notepad++'s Settings > Style Configurator window. 

Currently only has syntax highlighting for C, Python, and XML but you can get the same effect by selecting "Enable Global Foreground Color" on an unsupported language. Only the bold keywords will be missing.

The font used in the image is Scientifica, you can get it from here - https://github.com/NerdyPepper/scientifica
